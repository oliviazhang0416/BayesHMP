This folder includes the figures generated from the Posterior predictive check (PPC)!

We conducted a posterior predictive check to detect potential model misfits. The idea behind posterior predictive checking is that, if the model is a good fit, then we should be able to use it to generate data that looks much like the data we observed. The figures below show the simulated outcomes (counts of nonfrail, prefrail, and frail) overlaid by the observed counts for 2011, 2015, and combined cohorts respectively. We conclude that the model is fitted with reasonable priors and likelihoods.

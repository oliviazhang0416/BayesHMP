In addition to the half-Cauchy prior, we considered two alternative priors:

1. inv-gamma(0.001,0.001), which is recommended in Gelman's paper
2. half-norm(0,10)

I checked the following three aspects for each choice of prior:

- Convergence for each parameter (trace plots)
- Posterior densities for each parameter
- Frailty estimates

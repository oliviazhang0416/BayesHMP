In addition to the Half-Cauchy prior, we considered two alternative priors for the variance parameters (sigma):

1. Inverse-gamma(0.001,0.001)
2. Half-norm(0,10)

We checked the following three aspects for each choice of prior:

- Convergence (trace plots)
- Posterior densities for each parameter
- Frailty estimates
